# Little Flower Library Management System - Complete Workflow Demonstration

## System Overview
The library management system implements a request-based borrowing workflow where:
- **Students and Teachers**: Can only REQUEST books, not directly borrow them
- **Admin**: Has full control to review, approve, or reject requests and assign books
- **15-Day Period**: All approved books have automatic 15-day borrowing period
- **Auto Fine Calculation**: 1 rs per day fine after due date expires

## Complete Workflow Demonstration

### 1. Student/Teacher Book Request Process

#### Step 1: Browse Books
- Students/teachers access book search page
- View available books with clear availability indicators
- Books show "Request Book" button instead of "Borrow" button
- System shows if book is already borrowed or has pending request

#### Step 2: Submit Request
- Click "Request Book" to open detailed request form
- OR click quick request button (lightning bolt) for instant submission
- Optional: Add message explaining why book is needed
- System creates book request with pending status

#### Step 3: Request Tracking
- Request appears in student dashboard "Pending Requests" section
- Status shows: Pending, Approved, or Rejected with admin response

### 2. Admin Request Management Process

#### Step 1: View All Requests
- Admin accesses "Book Requests" from dashboard
- See comprehensive table with all requests (pending, approved, rejected)
- View request details: user, book, message, timestamp

#### Step 2: Review and Process
- **Approve Request**: Click approve button → automatically creates transaction with 15-day due date
- **Reject Request**: Click reject → provide reason → request marked as rejected
- System logs all admin actions for audit trail

#### Step 3: Alternative Assignment
- Admin can also use "Direct Assignment" to assign books without requests
- Useful for library events, class assignments, etc.

### 3. Book Status Visibility

#### For Students/Teachers:
- **Available Books**: Shows "Request Book" button
- **Borrowed Books**: Shows "All Copies Borrowed" - cannot request

- **Your Pending Requests**: Tracked in dashboard

#### For Admin:

### 4. Fine System Implementation

#### Automatic Calculation:
- Due date set to 15 days from approval/assignment

#### Return Process:
- User clicks "Return Book" from their dashboard
- System calculates any applicable fines

- Logs return with fine details if applicable

### 5. Current Sample Data

#### Active Transactions:
1. **Student1 → "To Kill a Mockingbird"**: Active borrowing (within 15 days)
